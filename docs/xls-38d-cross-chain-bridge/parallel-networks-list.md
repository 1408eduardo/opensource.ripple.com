# List of Parallel Networks

This page lists the parallel networks available for interoperability.

The XRP Ledger Explorer provides a way to look up historical transactions, accounts, ledgers, fees, exchange rates, timestamps, sequence numbers, node uptime, IP addresses, topology, versions and peers for the XRP Ledger mainchain. 

Similarly, you can use the [XRP Ledger Custom Network Explorer](https://custom.xrpl.org/) to connect an XRP Ledger Sidechain (_issuing chain_) and look up network information. 


## Cross-Chain Bridges

Locking chain: sidechain-net1.devnet.rippletest.net

Issuing Chain: sidechain-net2.devnet.rippletest.net

Sidechain Faucet: sidechain-faucet.devnet.rippletest.net
