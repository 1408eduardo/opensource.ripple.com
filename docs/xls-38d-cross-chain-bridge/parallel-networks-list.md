# List of Parallel Networks

<embed src="/snippets/_xchain-bridges-disclaimer.md" />

This page lists the parallel networks available for testing interoperability features.

You can use the [XRP Ledger Custom Network Explorer](https://custom.xrpl.org/) to look up parallel network information, such as historical transactions, accounts, ledgers, fees, exchange rates, timestamps, sequence numbers, node uptime, IP addresses, topology, versions, and peers.

**Note:** If you need to monitor a network with custom transactions, or just want to run your own instance of the explorer, see the [README](https://github.com/ripple/explorer).
