# Open Source Projects @ Ripple

Ripple contributes to the maintenance and development of XRP Ledger and collaborates with the wider XRP Ledger community to developer new features and capabilities for the ledger.

Documentation for features in development will be available on this site. 

Features and amendments go through the consensus process for approval to merge into the XRP Ledger code base. Once a feature is merged on the `rippled` codebase, documentation for that feature will be available on [xrpl.org](https://xrpl.org).

To learn more about the consensus process and the workflow for features to go from an idea to activation on the XRP Ledger, see <https://xrpl.org/amendments.html>.
